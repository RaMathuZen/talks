* What
[[./assets/distrobox.png]]

- a wrapper over docker/podman
- *"any distro userland to any other distro"*

* How

/"When you run an application in Distrobox, it mainly sees your actual home directory"./

/"Outside of your home directory, it sees the container’s filesystem."/

- Let's say there's a real estate with 10 plots (5 in right and left) near Pallavaram and the owner has a plan to build 2 houses on 2 plots.
  
** Consider two scenarios,

 1. One on Left and Right with seperate verandah, car  parking and gates.
 2. Both on Right sharing verandah, car parking and gates.

What those two corresponds ?

** Comparisions

- Real Estate - Host PC
- Houses (Both) - Host OS
- Rented House - distrobox container / docker
- Gate - Networking/Ports
- Car - USB Pendrive
- Tenant  helps you - Application/Functionality you wanted

* Why 

Use containers *highly integrated with the hosts*

and have access to,
  - the user’s home directory
  - networking
  - removable devices (like USB sticks), etc

You can even run entire DE (GNOME, Plasma, ...)!
    
** vs [[https://github.com/containers/toolbox][toolbx]]

a simplified way using POSIX sh and aiming at broader compatibility.

- *Necessity of a specific Linux distribution to export an application or a service from inside to the container, back to the host*.

* How I used 
[[./assets/ros1.jpg]]

- ROS 1 & 2 are best supported in Ubuntu

- Needed Ubuntu 22.04 for ROS2 Humble, while my main OS was Endeavour OS & Fedora
